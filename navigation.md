# Navigation

The Navigation menu in foreflow is located on the left side of the screen.  Depending on your rights as a user, you will see one or more of the following options:

- Home
- Users
- Roles
- Tables
- Datasets
- Connections 
- Tasks
- Batches
- Packages
- API Keys
- Reports
- Dashboards


Of course, clicking on any of these items will take you to that area of the application.  The bottom of the menu contains options for **About** and **Help** sections.  There is also an icon allowing you to collapse the menu in order to get more screen real estate.
