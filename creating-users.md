# Creating Users

You can see existing Users to which you have access by clicking the "Users" item in the menu.  These Users are listed in a sortable grid.  If you have Administrator rights, you will see an Actions column that contains icons for editing or deleting a user, and a button to add a new user.

When you click the "Add User" button on the Users page, you will be presented with a dialogue to provide the name, email address, and the timezone in which the user is located. When this form is saved, an email will be sent to the email address that was provided which contains instructions on how the user can access Foreflow, set up their password, and log in to foreflow.
