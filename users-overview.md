## Creating Users

You can see existing Users to which you have access by clicking the _Users_ item in the menu. These Users are listed in a sortable grid. If you have Administrator rights, you will see an Actions column that contains icons for editing or deleting a user, and a button to add a new user.

When you click the _Add User_ button on the Users page, you will be presented with a dialogue to provide the name, email address, and the timezone in which the user is located. When this form is saved, an email will be sent to the email address that was provided which contains instructions on how the user can access Foreflow, set up their password, and log in to foreflow.

## Editing Users

To edit a User, you will click the "Edit" icon for the user you would like to edit. This will take you to a page where you can modify basic properties of the user, and revoke certain roles from the user.

## Permissions

A user is given permissions based on the roles to which they are assigned. Roles are made up of one or more permissions. For example, you might have a role in Foreflow that can only read certain Datasets. If you would like to apply this role to a specific user, you would navigate to the Roles page, and edit the role to which you would like to assign the user. Once you are on the edit page for the Role, you can search for the user you would like to apply the role to in the "Users" panel. Click on the user that you would like the role applied to, and click "Update Role" to save your changes.

For more information on how foreflow handles permissions, please read the Roles and Permissions documentation.
