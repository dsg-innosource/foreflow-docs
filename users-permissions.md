# Applying Permissions to Users

A user is given permissions based on the roles to which they are assigned. Roles are made up of one or more permissions. For example, you might have a role in Foreflow that can only read certain Datasets. If you would like to apply this role to a specific user, you would navigate to the Roles page, and edit the role to which you would like to assign the user. Once you are on the edit page for the Role, you can search for the user you would like to apply the role to in the "Users" panel. Click on the user that you would like the role applied to, and click "Update Role" to save your changes.

For more information on how foreflow handles permissions, please read the Roles and Permissions documentation.
