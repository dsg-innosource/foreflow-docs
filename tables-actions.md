## Introduction
The _Table Actions_ button is on the [Properties](tables-properties#table-actions) page and gives you the power to add existing [Orchestrate](orchestration-overview) _Task, Batch and Package_ actions to your table.  When a _Table Action_ is added to your table, users with the appropriate permissions can run that task from the _Table Detail_ page.
