# Table Management

You can see existing Tables to which you have access by clicking the “Tables” item in the menu.  These tables are listed in a sortable grid.  If you have Administrator rights, you will see an Actions column that contains icons for editing or deleting a table, and a button to add a new table.

## Adding Tables

### Manually Creating a Table

When you click the “Add Table” button you will be prompted to enter a table name and description.  After entering those, clicking the “Save” button will return you to the Tables listing, where you should notice your new table.

### Creating a Table via File Upload

When you click the "Add Table From File" button you will be prompted to upload an Excel or CSV file.  Once you select a file and upload it into foreflow, the system will analyze the file in order to determine adequate datatypes for each column in the file.  You will be prompted to make adjustments to column names, datatypes, and validation rules prior to the table being created.

Once you verify the column names and datatypes, clicking the "Save" button will save the table.  Once the table has been created, the file you used to create the table will be imported into the table.
