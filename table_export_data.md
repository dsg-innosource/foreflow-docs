# Exporting Data from a Table

You may want to download data from a foreflow table to analyze it in Excel or use it in another application or system.  To do this, use the **Export Data** feature.

In the body of the table there is an **Export Data** icon.  It is an image of a **File Folder** with an **X** in the middle of it.

Navigate to the table from which you want to export data, and click on the **Export Data** icon.

You will then see a dialog box appear with **Queue Export** and **Cancel** options.  When you select **Queue Export**, foreflow schedules a **Task** that exports the data.  

When the export is done, you will recieve an email with a **Download File** link.  Clicking this will download your data in .xlsx format.
