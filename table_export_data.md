# Tables: Export Data

One of the features of foreflow is the ability to export data.  This page explains the steps to take in order to make that data export happen. 

## Exporting The Data

In the body of the table there is an **Export Data** icon.  It is an image of a **File Folder** with an **X** in the middle of it.

When this **Export Data** icon is clicked an **Export Data** dialog box appears with **Queue Export** and **Cancel** options.  

- The act of exporting data is a **Task** that needs to be scheduled.  Behind the scenes foreflow adds this task to a **Queue** of **Tasks** for the server to accomplish. 

- When the **Queue Export** button is clicked a a fleeting green alert will appear with the message **Export Queued**. 

Finally, as the server finishes the Export Data task, an email is sent to you with a **Download File** link informing you that your data export is now available.  Clicking this link will dowload this data in an .xlsx file format.
