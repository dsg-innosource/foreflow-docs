## Introduction

To run a report, you can click the _Run_ icon for the report you would like to run. This will present a dialogue where you can specify the parameters for the report, as well as an export type for the report. Once you have provided the report parameters and an export type, you can click the _Run_ button to begin processing the report. When the report has been rendered, the dialogue will display a _Download_ button which can be clicked to download a copy of the rendered report.
